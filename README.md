## Mark Dobbins

I recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy), a 16-week software development bootcamp based in London.

## Skills

#### Approaches problems analytically

When faced with a seemingly intractable problem, I resolve it whenever possible into a series of smaller, manageable problems, and determine how they depend on one another. I often make use of flowcharts or other diagrams as an aid in writing organised code. 

#### Learns quickly...

I readily absorb new information and find ways to relate it to my previous knowledge.

#### ...but also diligently

I believe very few challenges in life are truly unprecedented. I am happy to spend time researching cases in which others have experienced similar issues, and to learn from their experiences.
